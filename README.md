# Markov Chains for Betting and Stock Analysis

**Tags:** Markov Chains, Stochastic Modeling, Stationary Distributions, Finance, Game Theory

## Overview

This project explores the application of **finite-state Markov chains** in two stochastic domains:

1. **Stock Price Dynamics**  
   Stock prices are modeled as Markov processes to analyze:
   - Transition probabilities between price states
   - Stationary distributions (long-run price behavior)
   - Expected time to reach certain price thresholds

2. **Gambling & Betting Strategies**  
   Betting systems are simulated using biased coin tosses and wealth constraints, allowing exploration of:
   - Win/loss probabilities over time
   - Adaptive betting strategies
   - Expected game durations and wealth evolution

## Features

- **Markov Chain Construction**: User-defined state space and transition matrix for both applications.
- **Stationary Distribution Computation**: Solves for long-run behavior using linear algebra.
- **Expected Hitting Times**: Calculates time to reach key states (e.g., profit/loss thresholds).
- **Betting Strategy Simulations**: Models gamblerâ€™s ruin, Martingale, and bounded-risk strategies.
- **Modular Design**: Code is cleanly separated into stock models and gambling models for extensibility.
